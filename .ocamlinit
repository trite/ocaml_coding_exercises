(* Makes dune build the project specifically for use in utop.
   Just run `utop` from the root of the project. *)
#use_output "dune ocaml top";;

(* Don't feel like typing out `Ocaml_coding_exercises` each time
   but still want the project name to stay the same *)
open Ocaml_coding_exercises;;

(* Update this for whichever code problem is currently
   being worked on to avoid needing to use the long-form
   name or needing to call `open` after each restart. *)
open Y22day04;;

(* Alternately this is an option:
module Oce = Ocaml_coding_exercises;;
open Y22day01;; *)
